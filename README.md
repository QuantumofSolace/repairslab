*This repo is not the official repo by yavor87/repairslab (also on SourceForge at https://sourceforge.net/projects/repairslab/)*

The system RepairsLab allow to manage the entry and exit of equipment repair in a small workshop for repairs or service center.

The application allows the printing of a "Repairs sheet" for each device and manage the state of repair. Inside the Repairs ticket, you can enter the features of the delivered and the state of repair.

The system provides management of different master data for definition of states of repair, customers, types of equipment, trademarks and models.

You can print a paper "Repairs sheet" in duplicate to store paper and as a delivery receipt for the customer.
